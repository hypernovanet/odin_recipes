                <li>4-6 pieces of chicken </li>
                <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the coating</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For frying</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable oil for frying; enough to cover the chicken pieces in the pan</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>   
        <h3>Marinate the chicken</h3>    
            <Ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce (if using), salt, and pepper. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged. </li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. This will tenderize the chicken and add flavor.</li>
            </Ol>   
        <h3>Prepare the coating</h3>   
            <ol>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Coat the chicken</h3>  
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade, allowing any excess liquid to drip off. </li>
                <li>Dredge each piece in the seasoned flour, making sure it is fully coated.</li>
                <li>Shake off any excess flour and place on a wire rack or plate. Let sit for about 15 minutes to help the coating adhere.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Heat the oil</h3>   
            <ol>
                <li>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, pour in enough oil to submerge the chicken pieces (about 2-3 inches deep). Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). You can test the oil by dropping a small piece of bread in; if it sizzles and bubbles, it's ready.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Fry the chicken</h3>  
            <ol>
                <li>Carefully place a few pieces of chicken in the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan, this will cause the temperature to drop.</li>
                <li>Fry for about 10-15 minutes per side, or until the chicken is golden brown and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the oil temperature.</li>
            </ol>

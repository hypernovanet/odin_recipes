    <p>Ramen is a beloved and versatile Japanese noodle soup that has captured the hearts (and taste buds) of food enthusiasts around the world.

    <p>Typically garnished with a delightful array of toppings, ramen can include slices of tender chashu (braised pork), marinated soft-boiled eggs, fresh green onions, nori (seaweed), and a variety of vegetables. This adaptability allows for endless creativity, enabling cooks to tailor their ramen to suit their personal preferences or dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <h3>Prepare the broth</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, water, soy sauce, miso paste, ginger, garlic, and green onions. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Allow it to simmer for about 15-20 minutes to let the flavors combine. If desired, strain out the ginger, garlic, and green onions afterward for a clearer broth. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Cook the chicken</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>In a separate pan, add enough water to cover the chicken thighs. Bring it to a boil and then let it simmer for about 10-12 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.</li>
             </ol>
        <h3>Soft-boiled the eggs</h3>
             <ol>
                <li>In a small pot, bring water to a boil. Carefully add the eggs and boil them for about 6-7 minutes for a soft yolk.</li>
                <li>Remove the eggs and immediately place them into a bowl of ice water. Once cooled, peel the eggs and slice them in half. You can marinate them in soy sauce for added flavor.Remove the eggs and immediately place them into a bowl of ice water. Once cooled, peel the eggs and slice them in half.
